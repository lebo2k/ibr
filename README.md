# ibr
This is my C++ implementation of the Woodford 2008 paper "Global Stereo Reconstruction under Second Order Smoothness Priors" included here.

IBR_Preprocess_GPU
Computes stereo reconstruction from reference images.  It is GPU-accelerated.

IBR_Viewing
A viewer application to render pre-computer stereo reconstructions.  Synthesizes new views in real-time with mouse arcball controls.
