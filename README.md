This is my C++ implementation of the Woodford et al 2008 paper "Global Stereo Reconstruction under Second Order Smoothness Priors" included here.

<h1>IBR_Preprocess_GPUM</h1>: Computes stereo reconstruction from reference images.  It is GPU-accelerated.

IBR_Viewing: A viewer application to render pre-computed stereo reconstructions.  Synthesizes new views in real-time with mouse arcball controls.
